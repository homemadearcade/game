  -- How much damage does it do?
  -- Start with just rock paper scissors??
  -- how to handle animations?
  -- The key to CONVENIENCE is also making sure this system works without TRIGGERS
  -- allow a system for pattern recognition ( with patterns, timing )

Create an onSequenceComplete thing..? So when its done we know to move onto the next event

—
Apply sprite change to all sprites

in triggers also allow
— delete object after

Start mod on collide tag

--

sub object top vs bottom...

every one gets their own construct editor drawing things, the problem is then that I have to deal with the layering issue...

Right click ( start game with heros here )

bouncing ball

ADMIN to reselect sprites, remove sprites, combine sprites into animations

special camera relation, 0, .5, 2, 10, etc. might wanna encapsulale the camera changing logic into a function?

add object needs to be its own thing with effect, wait, condition, etc.
Its getting really complicated. For now im going to cheat it. It should have its own service and its own sequence type, feel me?

Combine spawning with anticipatedAdd. create like spawnType variable which defaults to, hatchFromParent

WORLDLIBRARY - Turn the editor world switching into something pulled out of a library, you feel me?..

Allow circles and triangles?

Camera filters ??? Yeah? Like the pixie demo? Let them customize the LOOK and feel of it all

Randomize animations and physics?

Select emitter from right click menu list, this is not a live emitter, its a direct lookup :)

right click - follow object, follow with path object

If object is outside of its custom grid to start off, It will not be able to find the correct grid
Theres needs to be a flag, perhaps the _fresh flag that allows it to use the other pathfinding grid to make its away to the new path

ATTACK which is like initial acceleration when there is no acceleration yet, jump attack speed, etc
tag: sharpTurns ( velocity is positive and decreasing, increase this power )
event: onObjectTurn
Object 'swinging' like on a rope. I mean... awesome right?
input modifiers....'on ice', 'flat'
// planet gravity! Would be cool to have..

I want actual grid node by grid node movement and grid collision system. I want grid movement for OBJECTS too
TRUE zelda camera work

mini-map
map rotation having problems 1) object stage already pivoted for camera reason 2) admin canvas is not rotating with

// ELEVATION IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A VISUAL ILLUSION ( see littlewood game )
By view so you can see certain objects based on ur view like 'xray goggles'! teehee
Background animation tag ( perhaps background stage and everything…)
Add animations to an object, custom animations? More than one like an array of them.. lol
add custom input behavior is broken but maybe thats good
in-game checkpoints
// gun that swaps places with what it hits! so cool..
// 3d sound effects system from papa bear
// layered object select when right clicking. ( for invisible areas and parent areas ) ( object selected will be an array and then the menu will choose between those )
// global compendium service that I can add to remove without copying and pasting JSON
// KING MODE ( where its like you make various yes/no choices and that changes whats happening on the world map )
// local mods? ( client only mods for specific players/situations )
// pixiChild._stillUsed property as well as a PIXIMAP.objectsById system. We scrap app PIXICHILDs that arent in use every like 10s

PLANS FOR ULTIMATE MINECRAFT SCALE

// moving grid based on hero ( chunks ) and only run simulation on those objects in the grid\
  // the problem is te pathfinding grid, hard to update that, too

Basically the grid will be a moving grid
the x and y of each grid node will get a getter based off the startX and startY and gridX
the grid will move its startX and startY with each hero with as its CHUNK

chunk padding is only used to calculate shadows as of now
CHUNK padding is the difference between the players view and the grid

It seems that theres VIEW padding and game padding. VIEW Padding seems to be for camera shakes and for moving very fast
game padding seems to be for smash brothers style deaths and managing object updates ( like mine craft )

A game boundary would likely dissapear, same with a camera lock
and then you would just have a grid that moves with you, the server would know each heros grid size and location
and update things accordingly

UPDATE ON THIS
If we seperate custom grid props from a path object and turn custom grids into their own objects, we can give the hero its own custom grid as a sub object and have monsters hook into it when they are in the area!

// SERVER MODE USING NENGI
// basically... HOST MODE and ARCADE MODE work as a great combo for home made arcade
// ^^ host mode and arcade mode would BREAK if i used a server model for running the game
// HOWEVER when trying to do accurate combat in multiplayer, we are going to want to have all the power of NENGI
// In that scenario i will try to implement server mode which will basically remove a client host and
// will make the server authoritative and solely responsible for updating, ill need to do a lot of changing...

// HOST GAME VS CLIENT GAME and their physics system, etc. right now non-hosts dont add subobjects for what reaason?? Its because adding aa sub object is quite complicated logic

// event system main problem is the different between onDeleteObject and 'onDeletedObject', very important, causing many issues :(

// allow pixi child sub object to go underneath their owner instead of always above, use tags please the whole time

// event system for physics, game logic, rendering, network update, ui, seperating helps!

// this is really scary. the host CANNOT refresh the page if any mods are used. The server is saving the modded version of the game currently because thats what we send to the clients

// revise physics system structure, allow like 'center point' to be changed and have it be used by default.
// ^^ so that rotation isnt a hack
// Rotational velocity also needs to be default.

// re organize parent, relative, owner, etc. What do these really all mean and why??
// event system is NOT named right. onDelete vs delete for example. I think that ones good, but like... 'startQuest'
// like whats our patterns. Is it Host Sends event through network -> Host picks up event through network?

// implement lodash fully with diffs, etc
// a try catch that if theres an error, the editor asks for a version of the game from like 1 minute ago
// switch tag fresh to an _fresh ( actually just go through all object state and make sure its consistent, there are others such as !!!target!!!<---( please make _ ) that could be an underscore property )
// lastHeroUpdateId, velocity? , i gridX, width, etc

// debug tools such as ( view all possible effects this object can have )
// view current POWERS
// VIEW DIFF from default version of this object

// auto save game state to DB, restore game state
// combine objectsById and objectsByTag with hero versions. Heros ARE objects. We can use .objectList and .heroList to diffentiate
// gameState => worldState
// convert all 'guestObject', 'mainObject', 'ownerObject' things to just ID stores
// dev dependencies to try to lower build file size

// DELETING object keys doesnt work, it just skips that update of that key. We need a good system for this

// another effects phase after correction, this is for things that should not be triggered unless it was legal

// we need more patterns to interact with the rendering system.
// standards for Adding Object to Game -> Add Object to Physics ->
// standards for edit object vs update object
// standards for network update/edit vs local update/edit
// many more standards for many more features
// Standards for DELETE, ADD, REMOVE, SPAWN, RESET, INITIALIZE, HIDE, (DISABLE?)

// CLIENT_GAME vs HOST_GAME

// local vs global positions, it makes total sense when you realize OH I need a global X for the entire game and local one thats more for the immediate surrounds and whats being rendere. Thers TWO axis

// ok so inssteadd of aappendding all these children to the dom, we should have a specified order so that we dont have to be gnarly with z ordering

// separate hero and PLAYER. the hero is just a game object then...

// queuing world and other updates so we can 'flush' them like feedly does

// admin vs player code much better seperated

/*
they play the first papa bear until someone unlocks papa bear AKA eating the apple
They unleash evil into the world
Much devestation is done, this is the first apacalypse ( there are many )
The story is told. This is like a good first game tutorial pack
We SAVE the world and the ruins and EVERYTHING for the next game
perhaps theres like an 'aging' features that adds vines and stuff and forests grow and stuff

// EPILOGUES happen after the game and the stats. Everyone reflects on what happens and then we let the survivors record this moment into history
// we get a short peacetime where meaning is basically consolidated into history or art. Graves are made perhaps?

// SO i think basically papa bear is always optional to add to the equation but papa bear is always the most powerful narrative device
// other than that there is THE SCENARIO OF THE GAME. Think about various apocalpyse games ( moon coming down, winter coming, meteor coming, zombie army coming, tournament is being held, dragons being revived, new technolog released, etc )
// also maybe think about other premises such as murder mystery, secret hidden item, new king problem
// but destroying papa bear, the ultimate original evil of man is the most epic story. Papa bear is the SAURON, the NARAKU, the VOLDEMORT

// Youll need to have a good gauge as to the narrative power that items in the game have and that papa bear has and that each of these events have
// also theres a question as to if it will be beneficial for me to be there or not? I think to start off im going to have to watch every game and make sure it ends right, but eventually ill learn the systems involved to make it work


// I was thinking and if you want to make this extremely high quality. Youll want to add a dungeon master to each game. This dungeon master also needs to be be able to deal with the software
// What reigns could I REALLY give to the users. Is there a scope that works? I would need to define the world rules completely and the scope of it essentially completely. The scope wouldnt be able to change right?
The queestion is.. can the game be REALLY meaingful if the way the user interacts with it ISNT meaningful
What makes a game item meaningful is its POWER either horizontal or vertical POWER. Most games only deal with vertical power
other way to make an item meaningful is through history and narrative..

IM GOING TO START OFF WITH HAVING A GAME MASTER PRESENT AND THEN EVENTUALLY ILL LEARN WHAT THE PARTS I CAN SACRIFICE ARE
