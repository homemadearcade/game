Game Over State
	specifically allow a hero to be destroyed and have the game run still?

Take a look at MonsterEffect
  Maybe just add like a variable choice of what something destorys

Home made arcade music

experience password for ha-live.
Have a random number based on the day, every will need to use that same number.
The first person that logs on with that number makes the server remember that number and only allows connections with that number

also add opening cutscene automatically at the start!
