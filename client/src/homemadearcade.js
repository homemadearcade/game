TODO - ALMOST THERE!
/////////////////////////////////
Game Over State
	specifically allow a hero to be destroyed and have the game run still?

Take a look at MonsterEffect
  Maybe just add like a variable choice of what something destorys

Randomize hero physics

Home made arcade music

experience password for ha-live.
Have a random number based on the day, every will need to use that same number.
The first person that logs on with that number makes the server remember that number and only allows connections with that number

Change id of game to the user that is the center of attention, figure out what we want the game title at the beginning and end to be called
  also add opening cutscene automatically at the start!

////////////////////////////////

this https://github.com/alexeyivanov94/combination-lock-react FOR NUMBERS

tag -- spawnAllInHeroInventoryOnPuzzleComplete
